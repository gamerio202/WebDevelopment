    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My main hobby is gaming, and thus my hobbies are related to this in one way or another.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Game collector:</b></p>
            <p>I collect games originating from all kinds of systems; as old as the Nintendo Game Boy, and as new as the Nintendo Switch 2.
                <br>I find game preservation to be important as it's a form of art that's unfortunately not looked after too well.</p>

        <li>
            <p><b>Completionist</b></p>
            <p>While this goal seems unreasonable and unrealistic, it's still one I enjoy trying to work towards - completing all of the best-known games and their franchises.
                <br>Along with this, I like hunting achievements/trophies. However, I usually get side-tracked by something new. But still fun to try?</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Game Dev:</b></p>
            <p>As one would guess, being this passionate about gaming would obviously lead to one wanting to make them.
                <br>Though, for the time being, I'm still learning the ropes, and have nothing to show for, yet.</p>
